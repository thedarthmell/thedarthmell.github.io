It was a significant privilege to be part of the **Games for Change Türkiye Festival 2025**.

Unlike my usual technical talks on game design, this invitation was a unique pivot. I was asked to step forward primarily with my influencer identity, **"the Darth Mel."**

At the Fazıl Say Conference Hall in Beşiktaş Campus, I joined fellow creators **Sude Beyhan** and **Arya B.** for a critical panel discussion titled: **"Gender Equality in Game Streaming/Influencers"**.

### The Panel Discussion

We explored the complex realities of being a visible woman in the gaming ecosystem. Guided by insightful moderation, we tackled tough questions about facing toxicity on social media, our motivations for continuing despite the struggles, and what concrete steps can be taken to build a more inclusive industry ecosystem.

It was an empowering session about turning personal challenges into collective strength for the community.
