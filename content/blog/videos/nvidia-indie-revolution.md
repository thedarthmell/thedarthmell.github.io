summary: "Why optimization is dead in AAA games and how Indie developers are fixing the industry."
---

In my latest video analysis, I dive deep into the current state of PC hardware and the rising cost of gaming.

### The Problem with Modern AAA
It seems like developers are relying too much on DLSS and Frame Generation instead of optimizing their code. This forces players to buy expensive cards just to get 60 FPS.

### The Indie Solution
Indie developers work with constraints. This limitation breeds creativity.

### Key Takeaways
1.  **Hardware is not a crutch:** Optimization matters.
2.  **Art Direction over Graphics:** Stylized games age better than realistic ones.
3.  **Community Trust:** Indie devs listen to their players.
