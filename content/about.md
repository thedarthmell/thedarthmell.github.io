Hi! I am **Mel Yurttaş** (also known as **TheDarthMel** online).

 I’ve been making games for as long as I can remember. It started with scissors and glue, cutting up National Geographic Kids magazines to create my own tabletop and card games. When my brother introduced me to our first computer at age six, that physical creativity found a new digital home. With my father’s support, I dove into writing stories and poetry, learning the fundamentals of world-building long before I knew it was a career.

I always thought I’d be a scientist. I studied Geophysical Engineering, dreaming of working in space. But during university, my love for games turned into an obsession. I realized that the logic and math I loved in engineering were the perfect tools for Game Design. That was seven years ago, and I haven't looked back since.

My engineering background allows me to be more than just a designer; I speak the language of developers. I can write code, debug at the engine level, and build robust systems. On the flip side, my experience behind the camera gave me an instinct for Art Direction and Level Design, allowing me to visualize a scene even without formal art training.

I believe a Game Designer shouldn't just be an "idea person." We are the ones who transport abstract thoughts into a playable reality. That’s why I strive to master every part of the process, from System Design (my favorite playground) to Technical Art. Whether I’m working solo or leading a team, I’m not just someone who loves games; I am obsessed with the craft of making them.
