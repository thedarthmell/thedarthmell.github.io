Hi! I am **Meltem Yurttaş** (also known as **TheDarthMel** online).

* **Engines:** Godot, Unity, Unreal Engine 5
* **Languages:** C#, GDScript, Python
* **Focus:** Mechanics, Narrative Design, Player Psychology

#### Content Creation & Analysis
Under the handle **@TheDarthMel**, I create video essays and content about the gaming industry. I analyze game mechanics (like *Dark Souls*' level design) and discuss industry trends (such as the rise of Indie games vs. AAA hardware demands).
* **Platforms:** YouTube, Instagram, TikTok
* **Topics:** Game Analysis, Devlogs, Tech Commentary
